Test Suite for Event-Event Relations with Magnitude
This test suite is based on example sentences created by editors for the TI-REC training data. Due to some errors in the current version of Caevo, we distinguish between the current (expected) result and the desired (gold) result. The expected result for each sentence is shown in the 'Expected' column and the gold result is shown in the 'Gold' column. The test suite runs as part of the building process of Caevo and verifies that all test cases are annotated as expected. The rest of this file details the test cases and their status.
